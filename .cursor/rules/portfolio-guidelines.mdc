# Portfolio Web Development Guide (2025)

This guide outlines the recommended technologies and design principles for building a modern web portfolio in 2025, based on an analysis of needs for showcasing data engineering, data science, machine learning, and DevOps projects.

## Core Technology Stack

The recommended stack combines performance, developer experience, and modern best practices.

### Next.js 15
The primary choice for the frontend framework.
- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR):** Ensures excellent SEO for project visibility.
- **Performance Optimization:** Automatic code-splitting and other optimizations for fast load times.
- **Vercel Deployment:** Simplified, one-click deployment.
- **Mature Ecosystem:** Extensive documentation and a large community.

### TypeScript
Essential for building robust and maintainable applications.
- **Type Safety:** Catches errors during development, not in production.
- **Developer Experience:** Smart autocompletion and improved code navigation.
- **Maintainability:** Makes large codebases easier to manage and refactor.
- **Industry Standard:** A key skill for modern web development.

### Tailwind CSS
A utility-first CSS framework for rapid and consistent styling.
- **Utility-First:** Speeds up development without writing custom CSS.
- **Performance:** Automatically purges unused styles for a minimal production build.
- **Consistency:** Ensures a cohesive design system.
- **Accessible:** Easy to learn, especially for developers from non-frontend backgrounds.

## Recommended Architecture

- **Frontend:** Next.js 15 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- **UI Components:** [Shadcn/UI](mdc:https:/ui.shadcn.com) or [Headless UI](mdc:https:/headlessui.com) for building accessible component primitives.
- **Animations:** [Framer Motion](mdc:https:/www.framer.com/motion) for fluid micro-interactions and animations.
- **Deployment:** Vercel for seamless integration with Next.js.

## Design Trends for 2025

Incorporate these modern design trends to create a compelling user experience.

- **Dark/Light Mode:** Automatically adapt the theme to user's system preferences.
- **Subtle Animations:** Enhance UX without being distracting.
- **Expressive Typography:** Create a clear visual hierarchy for content.
- **Bento Grids:** A modern and visually appealing way to organize and showcase projects.
- **Micro-interactions:** Provide feedback and make the interface more engaging.
